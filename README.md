# File Handling Exercise

This exercise, part of the [Java course taught by Nelio Alves](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo) on Udemy, involves reading a .csv file from a specified system path and producing an output file called "summary.csv" located in a subfolder named "out". The source file must have columns for product name, price, and quantity. The output file should contain one column for the product name and another for the total value of the stock (product price multiplied by quantity).

Taking it one step further, I added the option for the user to select between overwriting or appending to the existing output file. Additionally, the program has been streamlined by enabling automatic deletion of the output file and directory once the execution is completed.

Note: the code uses semicolon as the delimiter in the .csv file, a convention commonly used in non-English speaking countries such as Brazil.
